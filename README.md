Features
--------
- Unidirectional PathTracer
- RadeonRays for building BVHs (Traversal is performed in a shader)
- Metallic-Roughness Material Model
- Texture Mapping (Albedo, Metallic, Roughness, Normal maps)
- Spherical and Rectangular Area Lights
- IBL with importance sampling
- Progressive + Tiled Rendering (Reduces GPU usage and timeout when depth/scene complexity is high)

Build Instructions
--------
Please see INSTALL-WIN.txt for the build instructions

Sample Scenes
--------
A couple of sample scenes are provided in the repository. Additional scenes can be downloaded from here:

TODO
--------
- ~~IBL importance sampling~~
- ~~Emissive geometry~~
- ~~Two-level BVH for instances and transforms~~
- Support for different texture sizes
- Performance improvements
- Support for rendering out animation sequences

- A huge shout-out to Cedric Guillemet (https://github.com/CedricGuillemet) for cleaning up the code, adding the UI, integrating ImGuizmo, cmake and quite a lot of fixes.

- Tinsel Renderer (https://github.com/mmacklin/tinsel) A really amazing renderer which has several features. A modified version of the scene description & loader are taken from here. Reference for MIS, light sampling
