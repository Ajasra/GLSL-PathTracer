GLSL-PathTracer
==========
A physically based Path Tracer that runs in a GLSL Fragment shader.

[Rank 3 Police Unit](https://sketchfab.com/models/d7698f6a7acf49c68ff0a50c5a1b1d52) scene by [Nika Zautashvili](https://nikvili.artstation.com/projects/xggaR)
Features
--------
- Unidirectional PathTracer
- RadeonRays for building the BVHs
- UE4 Material Model
- Texture Mapping (Albedo, Metallic, Roughness, Normal maps). All Texture maps are packed into 3D textures
- Spherical and Rectangular Area Lights
- IBL with importance sampling
- Progressive Renderer
- Tiled Renderer (Reduces GPU usage and timeout when depth/scene complexity is high)

Build Instructions
--------
Please see INSTALL-WIN.txt for the build instructions

TODO
--------
- ~~Actually use the normal maps (Right now they are just loaded and sent to the GPU but not used)~~
- ~~Move renderer configuration to scene file~~
- ~~IBL~~
- ~~Emissive geometry~~
- ~~IBL importance sampling~~
- ~~Two-level BVH for instances and transforms~~
- Support to render out animation sequences
- Displacement mapping
- Emissive mesh sampling
- Sun Sky Model
- Nested dielectrics
- Fix issues with normal map (Microfacet-based normal mapping?)
